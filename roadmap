Step 1: Planning and Requirements
  Define Objectives:
  Simulate an Earth Observation Satellite to provide real-time data on altitude, velocity, and temperature.
  Identify Parameters:
  Altitude: The height of the satellite above Earth's surface.
  Velocity: The speed and direction of the satellite in its orbit.
  Temperature: Internal and possibly external temperature of the satellite.
  Camera Status: Whether the satellite's observation camera is operational, malfunctioning, or in power-saving mode.
  Battery Level: Amount of power left.
  Solar Panel Angle: Angle of the solar panels relative to the Sun for energy harvesting.
  Choose Technologies:
  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries: NumPy for numerical operations, matplotlib for basic visualization, and maybe even pandas for time-series data.
  Database: MQTT for real-time data storage.


Step 2: Environment Setup
  Install Python, VSCode, and other libraries.
  Setup MQTT database.


Step 3: Basic Simulation
  Implement Basic Physics:
  Use simple equations of motion for orbital mechanics to calculate altitude and velocity.
  Implement temperature changes based on satellite's position relative to Earth and Sun.
  Sensor Simulation:
  Use random noise or statistical variation to simulate sensor errors or inaccuracies.
  Time Loop:
  Use a real-time loop to simulate changes in parameters over time.


Step 4: Real-time Database
  Use Python libraries like paho-mqtt to connect to an MQTT broker.
  Update the MQTT database with new readings in your real-time loop.


Step 5: Validation and Testing
  Validate that your physical models are producing realistic data.
  Test MQTT database updates and data retrieval.


Step 6: Documentation and Clean-up
  Use inline comments and create a README.md file.


Step 7: Review and Future Work
  Self-assess your work and note down areas of possible improvements.


Step 8: Publish
  Upload the code and documentation to a GitHub repository.
  Possible Extensions for Future Work:
  Add more sensors and variables like humidity, radiation levels, etc.
  Implement a machine learning model to predict certain parameters based on historical data.
  Develop a front-end dashboard to visualize the data in real-time.
  Simulate system failures and recovery mechanisms.
